# Running Zephyr on the IG60-BL654

This tutorial is a walk-through for the end user on how to get Zephyr apps running on the IG60-BL654 and publish the data generated by the app to AWS.
The OS used to run this tutorial is Ubuntu 18.04.

1.  Set up zephyr for building applications with the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)

  - The recommended starting version is [2.3.0](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/tree/zephyr-v2.3.0)
  - In step 5- Build the Blinky Sample use 'bl654_vdvk' for <your-board-name>
    * NOTE: If the build step isn't working properly check these two items:

        Don't forget to export these env vars or add them to your path
  
        ```
        # export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=zephyr
        # export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=~/zephyr-sdk-0.11.2
        ```

        You may need to update the dtc in order to build the app

        ```
        # wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/d/device-tree-compiler/device-tree-compiler_1.4.7-3ubuntu2_amd64.deb
        # sudo apt install ./device-tree-compiler_1.4.7-3ubuntu2_amd64.deb
        ```
   

2.  Patch the bluetooth sample app
  - Add this line to the bl654_dvk_defconfig in the Zephyr source. In boards/arm/bl654_dvk/bl654_dvk_defconfig:

    ```
    CONFIG_FLASH_LOAD_OFFSET=0x1000
    ```

  - The Zephyr source code contains a sample application that will advertise our BL654 and also scan for Ble devices. Modify the sample app in the zephyr source via a patch in order to generate some json content that will be sent to the /dev/ttyS2 device on the IG60.  Later, we will fetch this json in order to publish the device data in a Lambda.  
  
  - Apply this patch to the scan_adv app in zephyr/samples/bluetooth/scan_adv/src/main.c:

    ```
    diff --git a/samples/bluetooth/scan_adv/src/main.c b/samples/bluetooth/scan_adv/src/main.c
    index 3dd80c0dfa..207cf00ad9 100644

          .type       = BT_HCI_LE_SCAN_PASSIVE,

    +        .options    = BT_LE_SCAN_OPT_FILTER_DUPLICATE,
          .interval   = 0x0010,
          .window     = 0x0010,
      };
    ```
  - Copy the patch into a file called ble_demo.patch.  From the root of the zephyr tree apply the patch:

    ```
    ~/zephyrproject/zephyr$ git apply ble_demo.patch
    ```

3. Build the scan_adv sample application:
  
    ```
    # west build -b bl654_dvk samples/bluetooth/scan_adv --pristine
    ```

4. Package and upload the application

  - Packaging the hex file can be done with an application called 'UBUtil'.  Which can be found here: [UBUtil](https://github.com/LairdCP/ubutil)

  - Using the generated .hex file from the previous section, follow the [Generating Firmware Updates](https://documentation.lairdconnect.com/Builds/IG60-BL654-GREENGRASS/latest/Content/Topics/6%20-%20Software%20Reference/BL654%20Programming%20Guide/Generating%20Firmware%20Updates.htm) guide in order to create a package that can be installed on the BL654 in the IG60.

  - Install the newly generated package on the IG60 using the [fwloader lambda](https://github.com/LairdCP/igsdk/blob/master/aws/lambdas/bluetooth5/fwloader/fwloader.py)

  - Publish data to AWS using the [blescanner lambda](https://github.com/LairdCP/igsdk/tree/master/aws/lambdas/bluetooth5/blescanner)
